# RuralPathways

**RuralPathways** is an app designed to bring equity to the college application process for students from rural backgrounds.

As a rural student myself, I understand that the journey to college can look very different from that of urban or suburban students. This app is a resource I wish I had during my own college preparation â€” one that supports, informs, and empowers rural students every step of the way.
